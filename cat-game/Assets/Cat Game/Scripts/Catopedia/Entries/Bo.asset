  description: "Personality:  Snooty \r\n\r\nOwners: Charlie & Vanessa \r\n\r\nLives
    in: 23 Ragamuffin Road \r\n\r\nDescription: She will only play with the finest
    toys. Anything else she'll throw away. \n\n\nCharlie and Vanessa are a loving
    elderly couple who spend most of their time at home with their various children
    and grandchildren. Bo relishes the attention from all the people constantly around
    the house, basking in the never ending pats and toys she receives. All the cats
    want to be Bo's friend because of all the toys and guests she has. But Bo is very
    selective and only keeps a few close friends to share her toys with, and these
    friends she will do anything for. So when Tibbles called on Bo to fight for her
    Bo didn\u2019t hesitate, taking up her toys and standing by Tibble's side. "
