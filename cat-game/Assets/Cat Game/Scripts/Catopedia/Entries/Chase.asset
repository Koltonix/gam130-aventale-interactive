  description: "Personality: Intelligent \r\n\r\nOwners: Mark & Ellie \r\n\r\nLives
    in: 49 LaPerm Lane \r\n\r\nDescription: A master of technology, never seen without
    his robot steed. \n\n\nMark is a tech wizard, constantly buying the latest, most
    high tech things he can, whether or not he uses them. Chase receives the same
    treatment, and constantly has the newest, state-of-the art toys, cat feeders,
    litter boxes and automatic groomers. Chase has thrived in this environment, his
    curious nature finding every detail about his new toys and using them in strange
    and wonderful ways. He rarely even walks anymore, having figured out how to guide
    Mark's PurrBot with his tail to go wherever he wishes. He often parades Mark's
    new things to the other neighborhood cats, proudly wheeling around on his PurrBot
    through the back alleys of the houses. Chase is always ready to test out his new
    toys, so when Tibbles called on him to fight with her he jumped at the chance,
    riding his PurrBot into battle like a mighty steed.\r\n"
