  description: "Personality: Strong \r\n\r\nOwners: Jess & Gary \r\n\r\nLives in:
    18 Norforest Court \r\n\r\nDescription: Spends most of his time exercising and
    will only eat high-protein foods.\n\n\nA few years ago Jess got a gym membership
    as a new year's resolution, but unlike most she really followed through. Now the
    house is filled with training equipment, exercise gear, protein powder and low-fat,
    low-carb cat nibbles. Hercules doesn\u2019t mind though, and spends most his days
    alongside Jess while she trains. Now Jess is a semi-professional boxer, and Hercules
    is not far behind her. He still makes times for his friends between exercises,
    exploring the neighborhood with Bo and bringing protein treats to Jug. When Tibbles
    called him to fight he saw it as an opportunity to train with a group and eagerly
    accepted."
