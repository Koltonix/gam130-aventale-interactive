  description: "Personality: Jolly \r\n\r\nOwners: Bill, Pat & the kids \r\n\r\nLives
    in: 1 Ocicat Close \r\n\r\nDescription: Fat from years of being spoiled with treats
    and food. Always happy to help as long as he gets fed afterwards. \n\n\nThe family
    got Jug as a Christmas gift several years ago when the kids were still very young.
    Pat never really wanted a cat, but Jug was just so sweet she couldn\u2019t say
    no. Bill and the kids, Rosie and James, were so thrilled to have a pet they spoiled
    Jug terribly. It started as extra tidbit after dinner, 2 treats instead of 1 as
    a reward. But after years of this, Jug has become quite the fat and lazy cat.
    The family's tried dieting, they've tried exercise, they've tried everything they
    could think of, but Jug has remained as fat as ever. He is still the sweetest
    despite his increasing waist line, and any cats who find themselves in Jug's garden
    are met with a jolly meow and some leftover nibbles. When Tibbles called on him
    to fight he was excited to help his friends, he'll just need a minute to climb
    over the fence without it breaking under him."
