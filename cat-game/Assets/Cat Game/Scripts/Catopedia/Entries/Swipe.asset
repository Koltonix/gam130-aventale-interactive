  description: "Personality: Mischievous \r\n\r\nOwners: Hannah \r\n\r\nLives in:
    14 Abby Avenue \r\n\r\nDescription: Loves to pull a good prank. Very proud of
    his claws. \n\n\nHannah is a busy woman who spends most of her time out of the
    house, leaving Swipe alone to do as he pleases. Because of her work, Hannah rarely
    has time to care for Swipe, she just manages to feed him and clean his litter
    box. She hasn't cut his claws in several months causing them to become particularly
    pointy. This is perfect for Swipe, who's favourite pass time is begging passers-by
    for belly rubs and after a few good strokes swiping at their hands and scampering
    away. Swipe likes nothing more than a good prank, and is always ready to use his
    precious claws for any purpose, so when Tibbles called on him to fight he quickly
    sharpened his claws and leapt into the fight."
