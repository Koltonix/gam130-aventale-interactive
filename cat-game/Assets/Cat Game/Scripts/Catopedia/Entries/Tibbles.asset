  description: "Personality: Heroic \r\n\r\nOwners: Amy \r\n\r\nLives in: 21 Bengal
    Boulevard \r\n\r\nDescription: Tibbles and Amy love each other very much. She
    will do anything to get Amy back. \n\n\nEver since Tibbles was a kitten her and
    Amy have been bestest of friends. However, Amy eventually met Tom, and soon Tom
    was coming around their house more and more, taking Amy away with him. Tibbles
    didn't get as many pats anymore, so Tibbles started going out, meeting with the
    neighbourhood cats, making friends like Swipe, Bo, Rider, Hercules and Jug. This
    was fine, not as nice as when Tibbles was a kitten, but nice all the same. That
    was, until, Tom moved in, and with him came the final straw. Roxxie moseyed in
    with her poofy tail and hypoallergenic fur acting as if this house was hers. Amy
    gave Roxxie all the treats and Tom wouldnt let Tibbles play when guests came round
    anymore. This was too much, something had to be done. Tibbles called her friends
    to battle, and together they would force Tom and Roxxie out and reclaim Amy for
    Tibbles!"
